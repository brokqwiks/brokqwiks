I'm [Ilnur], a passionate teenage programmer with a love for coding. Currently, I'm immersed in projects that involve PHP, C#, Python, JS, and SQL. My main focus is on developing Firtex, a decentralized blockchain built in C#.

## 🚀 About Firtex

[Firtex](https://github.com/brokqwiks/firtex) is my decentralized blockchain project implemented in C#. I'm constantly working on enhancing its features and making it a robust platform. Feel free to check out the repository and contribute or share your thoughts!
